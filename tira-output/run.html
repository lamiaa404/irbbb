In this work, we propose a Residual-Duet Network leveraging textual and tree dependency information for Chinese question-answering sentiment analysis.

The transverse and longitudinal compression encoders are developed to capture sentiment evidence with disparate types of compression and different residual connections. We evaluate our model on three Chinese QASA datasets in different domains.

Previous work on multimodal sentiment analysis directly extracts feature representation of each modality and fuse these features for classification. Consequently, some detailed semantic information for sentiment analysis and the correlation between image and text have been ignored. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic network, namely MultiSentiNet, for multimodal sentiment analysis. We first identify object and scene as salient detectors to extract deep semantic features of images. We then propose a visual feature guided attention LSTM model to extract words that are important to understand the sentiment of whole tweet and aggregate the representation of those informative words with visual semantic features, object and scene.

Previous work on multimodal sentiment analysis directly extracts feature representation of each modality and fuse these features for classification. Consequently, some detailed semantic information for sentiment analysis and the correlation between image and text have been ignored. In this paper, we propose a deep semantic network, namely MultiSentiNet, for multimodal sentiment analysis. We first identify object and scene as salient detectors to extract deep semantic features of images.
